# Programming_Grade_Calculations
This program takes in an input file "in.dat" on your working directory.
Reads each grade and then prints out the grade along with its grade letter to a new file "out.dat"
At the end of the file also tells you how many students received each type of grade (3 A's, 2 C's....")
