# Programming_Grade_Calculations
This program takes in an input file "in.dat" on your working directory. Consisting of grades separated by newlines.
The program then reads each grade and then prints out the grade along with its grade letter to a new file "out.dat"
At the end of the file also tells you how many students received each type of grade (3 A's, 2 C's....")
An example "in.dat" file was also uploaded for you to put in with your working directory.
